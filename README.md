## Movies API Tutorial

Created for the tutorial I created on [Writing Tests for NodeJS API](https://itnext.io/writing-tests-in-your-node-js-api-application-cfb5592df466)

#Simple Movies API with Test using Jest

Repo Without Test, clone *Master* branch

Completed project with Test included, clone *Complete* branch

'Master' branch is Starter
'Completed' branch is Completed project


## Setup
- Clone repository
- Optionally, setup database on mlab or localhost. Edit `.env.sample` file to `.env` and add your config. It will still work with out this step.
- Run `npm install`
- `npm start` to run or `npm run dev` to run nodemon
- Enjoy!
